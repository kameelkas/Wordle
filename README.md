## Description
This project was an assignment where I was tasked to create a replica of the famous web application 
game 'Wordle'. My version of the game features a 4 letter mystery word that the user must guess within 4 attempts. There is a Light/Dark Mode toggle button, a hint button to provide the user with a clue to the word, and a button that displays instructions for the game. This assignment was to help solidify HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript skills. Additionally, as a post-project task, I used AWS Resources to create my own personal API that is used to retrieve a list of words that can be updated anytime as opposed to using the original API provided to me.
